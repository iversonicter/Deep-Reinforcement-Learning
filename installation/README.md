# Installation

There exist many simulation tools which provide the interactive environment for the machine-learning researchers. Here lists the installations of some popular simulators. The most famous one is Gym, the original DQN is bulit on it. After that, many researchers follow this paradigm and do all kinds of experiments. Besides, the Unity is young one but provides beautiful UI even 3D environment. With it, you can implement complex algorithms which more approximates the real life.

To facilate the researchers create their experimental environments, here are some quick handbook of installation.

## Gym installation 

```
git clone https://github.com/openai/gym.git
cd gym
pip install -e .
```
or minimal install of from pypi
```
pip install gym
```

## Unity installation

```
git clone https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents.git

cd ml-agents/

pip3 install -e .
```
